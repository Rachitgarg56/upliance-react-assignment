## Hosted Link: https://upliance-react-assignment.vercel.app/
## Overview
This project is a React-based web application built to fulfill a set of functional requirements. It includes components such as a counter, user data form, rich text editors, and a dashboard with user profile visuals. The project utilizes Material UI, React Spring, and React Router for UI design and navigation.

## Functional Requirements
1. **CounterComponent**
   - Create buttons for increment, decrement, and reset.
   - Maintain count across re-renders.
   - Implement background color animation with a linear increase, preferably using a bezier curve.
   - Reset the background color level to 0 on reset.

2. **UserDataForm**
   - Design a form for user data including fields for name, address, email, and phone number.
   - Autogenerate a unique user ID.
   - Save user data to local storage or RTK on form submission.
   - Show unsaved changes pop-up if there are unsaved changes when the user tries to close the browser.

3. **RichTextEditors**
   - Visualize user data in rich text editor format.
   - Integrate editors with formatting options such as bold, italic, underline, and lists.
   - Implement data persistence for the rich text content.

4. **Additional Features (Optional)**
   - User authentication with Google sign-in, including safe private routes.
   - Implement sign-in and sign-up functionality.
   - Dashboard visualization with user profile visuals.
   - Display user profile trends using hover flip cards.

## Technology Stack
- React
- Material UI
- React Spring
- React Router
- Clerk (for authentication)
- Jodit Editor (for rich text editing)
- Redux Toolkit (for state management)

## Learning from the Project
Throughout the project, I gained valuable experience in working with React, including the use of hooks and functional components. I also learned about integrating third-party libraries for authentication and rich text editing, as well as state management with Redux Toolkit. Additionally, I improved my skills in UI design, animation, and responsive web development.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the profile trends section and add more useful user insights.
- Different user experience for first time users.
- Make the UI more attractive.
- Optimize performance and responsiveness for better user experience across devices.
